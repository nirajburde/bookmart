NOTES
It's new for me to deploy web application on Heroku. And after limited number of failed attempts, due to lack of time, I'm sharing the 
github link to my code for Bookmart App.

Github Link -> https://github.com/nirajburde/bookmart

A .sql file is also included at the root of project which must be imported to a MySQL database named as 'bookmart'.
I request you to bear the inconvenience caused.

Now coming up to the features I've covered in this project:-
1. A user can sign-in to bookmart using his/her email address and password.
	- There are two users :-
		USERNAME				  PASSWORD
		nirajburde@email.com 	| nirajburde
		steven@email.com		| steven
	- The sign-up feature is skipped.

2. After signing-in, user has access to four pages from the menu bar i.e. Home, Hot Deals, Education and Magazines.
3. A user can add ebooks to his cart. Cart can be checked by clicking on 'Checkout' link at the top.
4. Once ebook purchased, user can go to 'My Books' page by clicking on another link at top. On click of 'Read Book', book will be 
	opened in another tab of browser.

#Design on certain pages are not complete as I focused on completing the back-end functionality.

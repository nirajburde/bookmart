B. 1110 (<i>ready for the pyre</i>), El. 222 (<i>ready for the glad journey</i>). Moreover, what has the idea of single combat to do with B. 1247 ff.? The poet is giving an inventory of the arms and armor which they lay aside on retiring, and he closes his narration by saying that they were <i>always prepared for battle both at home and on the march</i>.</div>

In the two Beowulf passages, the <span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæt</span>-clause is anticipated by ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">þæs</span>,’ which is clearly a gen. of the thing agreed on.
<p>The first passage (v. 1599 (b)-1600) I translate literally: <i>Then many agreed upon this (namely), that the sea-wolf had killed him</i>.</p>
<p>The second passage (v. 2025 (b)-2027): <i>She is promised …; to this the friend of the Scyldings has agreed, etc</i>. By emending ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">is</span>’ instead of ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">wæs</span>’ (2025), the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony.</p>
<p>In v. 1997 ff. this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.’s great article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my reading of 1599 and 2027. Translate 1997 then: <i>Wouldst let the South-Danes themselves decide about their struggle with Grendel</i>. Here ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">Súð-Dene</span>’ is accus. of person, and ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">gúðe</span>’ is gen. of thing agreed on.</p>
<p>With such collateral support as that afforded by B. (P. and B. XII. 97), I have no hesitation in departing from H.-So., my usual guide.</p>
<p>The idiom above treated runs through A.-S., Old Saxon, and other Teutonic languages, and should be noticed in the lexicons.</p>

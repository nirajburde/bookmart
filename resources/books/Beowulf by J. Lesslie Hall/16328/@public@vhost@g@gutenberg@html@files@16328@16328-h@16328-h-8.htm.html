One takes ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">oferhígian</span>’ as meaning ‘to exceed,’ and, inserting ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">hord</span>’ after ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">gehwone</span>,’ renders: <i>The treasure may easily, the gold in the ground, exceed in value every hoard of man, hide it who will.</i> The other takes ‘<span class="ang" xml:lang="ang">oferhígian</span>’ as meaning ‘to render arrogant,’ and, giving the sentence a moralizing tone, renders substantially as in the body of this work. (Cf. <a href="@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@16328@16328-h@16328-h-6.htm.html#L.XXVIII.13" class="pginternal">28 <span class="smaller">13</span></a> et seq.)</div>
